# libft
Re-code several functions of the standard C library, as well as other utility functions that will be of use through out my studies at Hive Helsinki.

I have fully made the libft functions myself.

The test files are a mix between my own and friends of mines tests. Thank you Tpolonen (https://github.com/kyyninen) for sharing your test files with me. Thank you Jumanner 
for showing me how to make the structure of the testfile and Makefile ( some of your tests are still present in the files but I'm working on removing them )
