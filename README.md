# libft
Re-code several functions of the standard C library, as well as other utility functions that will be of use through out my studies at Hive Helsinki.

I have fully made the libft functions myself.

The test files are a mix between my own and friends of mines tests (shoutout Tpolonen for sharing his test file with me).
